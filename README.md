# console_invaders

This is a small demo in C++: A Space-Invaders-like game entirely on the Windows console.

The game is playable, but needs improvements in playability to be more fun. It is just a proof of concept: if you do something with it, issue a pull request and I will be happy to merge it in.
I wanted to explore how manipulating the console buffer would allow us to make a game like programmers used to do in the old days of 8-bit home computers.

In any case, it was fun to program. Let me know where it leads you!
